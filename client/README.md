# EPollApplication

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.2.

## Development server

Run `npm install` then `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Template tables are not created on start, so need to be done in aws or just use createPoll tab in frontend.
